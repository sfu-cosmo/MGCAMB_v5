In general, Copter is concerned with the growth of structure in the universe at
late times.  For this purpose, the details of the early universe physics are
largely irrelevant.  Thus to completely specify a cosmology, only six parameters
and one function are required:
    h           - Hubble parameter today (with the convention H_0 = 100h km/s/Mpc)
    Tcmb        - CMB temperature today (generally taken as 2.726 K)
    n           - scalar spectral index of density fluctuations
    Omega_m     - fractional matter density today (including both dark matter and baryons)
    Omega_b     - fractional baryon density today
    sigma8      - variance of the linear power spectrum today, smoothed on 8 Mpc/h scales
    T(k)        - transfer function

The transfer function is typically calculated using an external program such as
CMBFAST or CAMB (although analytic fitting functions also exist).  This
function needs to be given in a data file, with the wavenumber k (in h/Mpc) in
the first column, and the transfer function (with arbitrary normalization) in
the second column.

Copter reads in cosmology information from .ini files, which are just plaintext
files with 'name = value' pairs.  See the examples/ directory for an example.
