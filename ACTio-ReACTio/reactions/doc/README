The documentation for Copter is still a work in progress.  For now the
following documents exist:
 - cosmologies.txt
        an explanation of what a Cosmology is to Copter, and how to specify
        your own
 - integration.txt
        a short primer on some of the general-purpose (and easy to use)
        integration routines implemented in Copter
